% Key Improvements:
%
% 1. Initialization of Variables:
%    - data is now continuously appended with new temperature readings, 
% making it easier to handle and understand.
%    - duration is set at the beginning to specify how long the loop 
% will run.
%
% 2. Rate Calculation:
%    - The rate of temperature change is calculated by comparing the last 
% two entries in the `data` array, ensuring that there is always a previous 
% value to compare to Conversion for the rate to °C/s is corrected and 
% simplified.
%
% 3. LED Control Logic:
%    - Simplified the control logic for LEDs using direct conditions.
%    - Used variable names for LED pins to make changes easier and the 
% code cleaner.
%
% 4. Predictive Temperature Calculation:
%    - The future temperature prediction now uses the correct rate of 
% change (considering the time span of 5 minutes).
%
% 5. Loop Condition and Efficiency:
%    - The loop now decrements `duration` correctly and will exit after the
% specified time.
%    - Added more informative print statements to track the rate of change
% and predicted temperature clearly.
%
% This revised code should be more robust, easier to maintain, and clearer
% in its operation. It also correctly handles the calculation of 
% temperature change rates and uses these rates to predict future 
% temperatures and control LEDs accordingly.
